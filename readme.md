/*================= Cuisine ===================*/

Cuisine is Chef du Web's WordPress framework that handles theme -> plugin communications and simplifies development a whole lot.

It has easy access to WordPress' permalink rewrite functions and theme customization-panels, auto javascript and stylesheet minifiers, and loads of other stuff that'll make your themes and plugins way way faster to develop and to load.

It offers both object-oriented as well as function-oriented approaches, so you can be nice and flexibile.

Cuisine is build and maintained by Chef du Web, but if you have any suggestions, you can alwasy request a pull-request. Input is always welcome.
